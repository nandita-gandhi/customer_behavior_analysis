# Customer Behavior Analysis
# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data loading to generating business insights through dashboards and reports.
The goal of the project is to analyze the dataset, uncover patterns and trends, and present insights using **SQL, Python, and Power BI** in a clear and actionable way.

This project reflects real-world data analyst responsibilities, including:

* Data exploration and cleaning
* SQL-based analysis
* Dashboard creation
* Insight communication through reports and presentations

---

## 📁 Dataset

* The dataset was initially loaded and explored using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.
* It contains structured data suitable for exploratory analysis, SQL querying, and visualization.
* After initial processing, the cleaned data was stored in a **MySQL database** for further querying.

*(Dataset details such as number of rows, columns, or domain can be added here if needed.)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis
* **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data manipulation and visualization
* **MySQL & MySQL Workbench** – Writing and executing SQL queries
* **Power BI** – Building interactive dashboards
* **Gamma** – Creating project presentation (PPT)
* **Excel / CSV** – Intermediate data handling (if applicable)

## 🔍 Project Workflow & Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

* Loaded the dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
* Checked data structure, column names, data types, and basic statistics.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed data distribution, trends, and relationships.
* Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Used visualizations (bar charts, histograms, box plots) to understand patterns.

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values using appropriate techniques.
* Removed or treated outliers where necessary.
* Standardized column formats and data types.
* Prepared clean and structured data for SQL and visualization.

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis (MySQL Workbench)

* Imported cleaned data into a MySQL database.
* Wrote SQL queries to:

  * Filter and aggregate data
  * Perform group-wise analysis
  * Extract meaningful business insights
* Used SQL results to validate Python-based findings.

### 5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to the MySQL database / cleaned dataset.
* Created interactive dashboards with:

  * KPIs
  * Trend analysis
  * Category-wise and time-based insights
* Used slicers and filters for better user interaction.

### 6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

* Documented findings in a structured project report.
* Created a professional presentation (PPT) using **Gamma**, focusing on:

  * Problem statement
  * Key insights
  * Visual results
  * Business recommendations

---

## 📈 Dashboard & Key Insights

* The Power BI dashboard highlights key trends and performance metrics.
* Enables quick understanding of:

  * Overall patterns
  * High-performing and low-performing segments
  * Data-driven insights for decision-making

*(You can add screenshots or a dashboard link here if available.)*
